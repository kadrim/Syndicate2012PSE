# Syndicate 2012 Private Server Emulator

This is a Fork from the [ME3 Private Server Emulator](https://github.com/PrivateServerEmulator/ME3PSE).

It is modified to allow playing the Coop-Missions of the Syndicate 2012 Game from Starbreeze Studios / Electronic Arts

Currently this is a heavy WIP and will only run with the PC or Xbox360 Version of the Game. Also it currently only allows multiplayer for the PC Version, on Xbox360 instead you can use it to start the Coop-Missions and play them solo.

## Usage

### Dependencies

- A legal copy of the game on one of the supported platforms.
- Windows PC, to host the services
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed

Download the [Latest Release](https://github.com/kadrim/Syndicate2012PSE/releases/latest) and extract the contents somewhere on your harddisk.

Edit the following files:

- `docker-compose.yml` | Replace the current value of `CLIENT_HOST` with the IP-Adress of your Windows PC
- `conf/conf.txt` | Replace the current values of `RedirectIP` and `REDIHOST` with the IP-Adress of your Windows PC
- `Xenia-WebServices/titles/45410923/servers.json` | Replace the current value of `address` with the IP-Adress of your Windows PC

Then open a terminal in the folder where you extracted the current release and run the following commands:

```
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

Afterwards execute the file `Syndicate2012Server.exe`. Your private server is now prepared! Other Players can connect to your server, they only have to do the steps for the corresponding client, mentioned below.

> Note: After a reboot you only have to execute the step `docker compose up` and execute `Syndicate2012Server.exe`. The `docker compose build` step is only needed when you downloaded a new release.

### PC Client

For the PC-Client you have 2 choices:

1. Run the Game unmodified
    - Pro: no need to modify any game files
    - Con: if you have another game that utilizes the domain `gosredirector.ea.com` you will most likely brick that other game
2.
    - Pro: you won't affect other games multiplayer experience
    - Con: you will have to patch a game file

#### Option 1

Edit your `hosts` file under `%windir%\system32\drivers\etc` and enter your IP Address and set it to `gosredirector.ea.com`

#### Option 2

Edit your `hosts` file under `%windir%\system32\drivers\etc` and enter your IP Address and set it to `gosredirector.local`

Use a Hex-Editor like [HxD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HxD) to edit the game file `System/Win32_x86_Release/MSystem.dll` and look for the string `gosredirector.ea.com`. Replace it with `gosredirector.local` and add the Hex-Code `00` directly after the string

Edit `docker-compose.yml` again and set the value of `LOCAL_FQDN` to `true`. Stop the current docker containers in the previously opened terminal by hitting `CTRL+C` and then run `docker compose up` again.

#### Playing

- Start the game and select `CO-OP`
- You will have to enter login credentials. The service comes with `4` premade users `player1`, `player2`, `player3` and `player4`, the password for all is `1234`
- If you want additional users, simply create new ones in the server using `Tools -> Create Player Profile`
- Within the game select `Create private game` and start it
- If another user shall join, he simply has to select `Play quick match` to join the previously created game

### Xbox360 Client

- Dump your original Game-DVD using your Xbox360 to an USB-Device (many Tutorials exist for that).
- Grab a release (i.e. v3.0.0) of [Xenia Canary Netplay](https://github.com/AdrianCassar/xenia-canary/releases)
- Start it once and exit right away
- Edit the file `xenia-canary-netplay.config.toml` and set the value of `api_address` to `api_address = "<YOUR-IP-ADDRESS>:36000/"`, i.e. `api_address = "192.168.1.100:36000/"`
- Then start xenia again and launch the game

### Linux Support

The game itself runs pretty decent on `SteamOS` and `Ubuntu` using [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) (add Syndicate as a non-steam game) and by turning on the compatibility using `Proton` (i.e. `Proton 9.0-4`, best results so far with `GE-Proton7-43`).

To use the Server on a Linux machine you simply have to copy the file `Linux/compose.override.yaml` to the root directory of this project (so one directory up). If you are running this on a desktop with GUI you can enable the GUI by editing the copied file and setting `HEADLESS` to `false`.

Afterwards rebuild and rerun the services by executing:

```
docker compose build
docker compose up
```
