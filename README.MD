# Syndicate 2012 Private Server Emulator

This is a Fork from the [ME3 Private Server Emulator](https://github.com/PrivateServerEmulator/ME3PSE).

It is modified to allow playing the Coop-Missions of the Syndicate 2012 Game from Starbreeze Studios / Electronic Arts

Currently this is a heavy WIP and will only run with the Xbox360 Version of the Game. Also it currently does not allow multiplayer, instead you can
use it to start the Coop-Missions and play them solo.
